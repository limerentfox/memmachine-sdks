# Best Practices

- Use `MemMachineProvider` high in your tree so components and hooks can access the client.
- For tests and Storybook, mock the client via the provider’s `client` prop (as shown in these stories).
- Keep components presentational and push data-fetching to hooks; components receive data via props or wrappers.
- Use the `status/loading/error` states from hooks to render clear UI feedback and avoid flicker.
- Ensure accessibility: visible focus states, semantic roles, and `aria-*` attributes are included where appropriate.
- Verify behaviour across breakpoints with the “Viewport” toolbar.
